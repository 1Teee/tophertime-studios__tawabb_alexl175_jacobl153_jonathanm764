  Py:
    -  Which aspects of the style guide were most applicable to your codebase?
        * Maximum line length of 79 characters, since we have a lot of long return statements,
          mostly stuff getting pushed to flask with jinja and render_template with variables
        * Imports of different libraries/modules should be on separate lines, because we have a
          lot of imports all on the same line in our python files
        * Documentation Strings throughout the whole repo, because it makes it easier to distinguish
          what a specific function does or returns at a glance without having to thoroughly analyze
          & decipher the code itself
    - Which aspects of the style guide were most useful/appreciated by your Devos?


  JS:
    -  Which aspects of the style guide were most applicable to your codebase?
        * Output of logs, pretty self-explanatory and similar to documentation strings in usefulness
        * Comments, specifically those with intention, for the same reasons listed above
